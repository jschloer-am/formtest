### Notes
- Break up form into 2 sections, Header, Body. Header holds an app title or logo, Body holds form and Save button
- Utilize useReducer for managing state
- Use a wrapping container for state loading 
  - Suspense would be better, but it's still experimental, so I try to avoid it
- Do conversion in the action for unnit change
- Use select dials for all entry
